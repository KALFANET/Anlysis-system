# Network Manager Setup Process

## Overview
This documentation describes the implementation of the initial setup process for the Network Manager system.

## Project Structure
The setup process includes components from multiple repositories:

1. **Backend** - API endpoints for network configuration and device discovery
2. **Client** - React frontend for setup wizard
3. **Agent** - Discovery and registration for network devices

## Setup Process Flow
1. Initial setup screen loads
2. Network connection check (Ethernet/WiFi)
3. System configuration
4. Device scanning and registration
5. Save configuration and restart

## API Endpoints
14 API endpoints were identified during analysis.

Key endpoints for setup:
- GET /api/network/status - Check network connection
- POST /api/network/wifi - Connect to WiFi
- GET /api/network/scan - Scan for devices
- POST /api/network/config - Save network configuration

## Development Guide
1. Clone the generated setup project
2. Install dependencies with `npm install`
3. Run the development server with `npm start`
4. Implement the full setup wizard following the specification
